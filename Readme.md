# Pocket Simulacrum
Using random sampling, many simulations are averaged to get the result. 

Simulations are only allowed to run until 20 seconds for performance reasons.

## Todo
~~Major optimizations~~ ~2x faster

~~-Get weapon info directly from mobile export~~

~~-Make some functionality to display individual damage numbers (for easier bug finding)~~

-Get build information from Warframe's API

~~Release JAR for easy execution (I have to figure out licensing)~~

-Add enemy specific DR functionality

## Known issues
~~-Status duration not fully set up~~

-DR for toxin damage against shielded demolyst (inconsistent in-game anyways)

-Heat armor regeneration not working correctly

-Higher crit tiers for acolytes not fully understood

## Things that may not be added (too weapon specific)
-Spool up weapon functionality

~~-Beam weapon damage ramp up~~
