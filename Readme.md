# Pocket Simulacrum
Using random sampling, many simulations are averaged to get the result. 

- Compare builds

- Calculate the best riven

- Accurately simulate enemies with special DR.

Note: Simulations are only allowed to run until 20 seconds for performance reasons (until I add separate threads).
