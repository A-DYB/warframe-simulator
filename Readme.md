# Pocket Simulacrum
This is a Monte Carlo simulator. That means using probability, many simulations are averaged to get the result. This aims to be REASONABLY close to perfect simulation, up to my discretion. If any problems are found, let me know.

## Todo
~~Major optimizations~~ 2x faster now

-Get weapon info directly from mobile export

-Clean up JSON 

-Make some functionality to display individual damage numbers (for easier bug finding)

-Get build information from Warframe's API

~~Release JAR for easy execution (I have to figure out licensing)~~

## Known issues
-Status duration not fully set up

-DR for toxin damage against shielded demolyst (inconsistent in-game anyways)

## Things that may not be added, unless largely requested
-Spool up weapon functionality

-Beam weapon damage ramp up
