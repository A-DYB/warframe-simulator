This is a Monte Carlo simulator. That means using probability, many simulations are averaged to get the result. This aims to be as close to the game's calculations as possible. If any problems are found, let me know.

Todo:
-Major optimizations
-Get weapon info directly from mobile export
-Clean up JSON stuff
-Make some functionality to display individual damage numbers
-Get build information from Warframe's API
